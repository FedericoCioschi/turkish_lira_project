# Turkish Lira Project

This repository contains the material produced for the Turkish Lira project, carried out for the Algorithms for Massive Datasets course of the University of Milan.

The task of the project was to implement from scratch an image classifier based on neural networks using TensorFlow.
In particular, the classifier had to take into account the images contained in the "Turkish Lira Banknote" [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/baltacifatih/turkish-lira-banknote-dataset) published on Kaggle.

The resulting classifier is able to take an image as input and provide as output the corresponding predictions w.r.t. the 5, 10, 20, 500, 100, and 200 lira classes.
